ðŸŒŸ Marvelpedia is an intricately designed application that stands on the cutting-edge of modern Android development practices. 
</p>
</br>

- **`MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel`)**: This project is structured around the MVVM architectural pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns, which improves the maintainability and scalability of the application.

- **`Multi-Module Architecture`**: Marvelpedia is organized into multiple modules, making the codebase more manageable and modular. This structure aids in better separation of features and functionalities, enhancing the overall development process.

- **`Clean Architecture`**: The overall architecture is based on Clean Architecture principles, promoting a more structured and decoupled approach to app development. This results in a codebase that's easier to test, maintain, and scale.

- **`Jetpack Compose`**: The UI components are built using Jetpack Compose, Google's modern toolkit for building native UI. This allows for a more flexible, concise, and reactive way to create user interfaces in Kotlin.

- **`Hilt` for `Dependency Injection`**: Hilt is used for dependency injection, simplifying the way dependencies are managed and injected into the application. This leads to more testable and maintainable code.

- **`Coil` for `Image Loading`**: For efficient and effortless image loading and caching, Coil, a Kotlin-based image loading library, is integrated. It's optimized for Jetpack Compose, making image handling smooth and responsive.

- **`Coroutines & Flow`**: Marvelpedia utilizes Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for managing asynchronous tasks and data streams, enhancing the app's performance and responsiveness.

- **`Room`**: Room, a component of Android Jetpack, is employed for database management. It provides a layer of abstraction over SQLite, making database access and data management smoother and more efficient.
